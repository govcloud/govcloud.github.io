      <description>Open First Day github.com/statcan 
Note:
This is a fun presentation for me because I get to talk about some of the open source work being done at Statistics Canada.
But more then that I get to talk about a philosophy that has been working its way in to the department and what appears to soon be the broader government as a whole.
If any Open Government people are here your the best!</description>
