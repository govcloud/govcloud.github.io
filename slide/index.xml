Hi there!
Welcome to what is I think is the 6th Cloud Native meetup.
I just hoping to mention before we begin that at the end of this session I was hoping to get advice from you all via a quick roundtable.
I really want us to take off in September and get a range of presenters in, but might need help.
I thought I would kick this off by talking about the upcoming presenters for those who are tired of seeing this one annoying guy :) &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; Points at self.</description>

Note:

Agenda  Planning Items Azure AKS / ACS Engine Auto Scaler ARK Disaster Recovery Distributed Logging Securing Helm  Note:
The agenda for today is to keep things a bit more straightforward (even though I said that last week).
Some constructive criticism already recieved was jumping around topics a bit which for the first meeting to form a broad base is fine but less ideal for meetings going onwards.</description>

      <description>Open First Day github.com/statcan 
Note:
Hi there!
This is a fun presentation for me because I get to talk about some of the open source work being done at Statistics Canada.
But more then that I get to talk about a philosophy that has been working its way in to the department and what appears to soon be the broader government as a whole.
If any Open Government people are here I just wanted to quickly say you are the best!</description>
